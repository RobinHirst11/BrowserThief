# BrowserThief
All in one Rubber Ducky/BadUSB that runs a powershell script to extract and steal browser-saved passwords and stash them at your Flask web server. It currently extract passwords from **Opera/OperaGX/Chrome**, I will be adding support for more browsers like Firefox soon!

## Features
- The powershell script runs in-memory and avoids writing to disk which evades Windows Defender detection

- Extracts Passwords from all Chrome Profiles, Opera and OperaGX
- Will be adding Firefox soon
